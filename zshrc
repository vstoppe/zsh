### Source in aliases. This way we can differentiate between general aliases and those for special environments:
source ~/.zsh/alias.d/*
# Source in extra shell functions
source ~/.zsh/functions.d/*
source ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/z/z.sh
### Seperate environment file for zsh:
source ~/.zsh/zshenv
source ~/.zsh/puppet.cfg
#if [[ "$OSTYPE" = darwin* ]]; then source macos.cfg; fi

case $OSTYPE in
	darwin*)   source ~/.zsh/macos.cfg;;
	linux-gnu) source ~/.zsh/linux.cfg;;
esac
